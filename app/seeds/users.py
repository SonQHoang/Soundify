                There was something so sweet about it, I'm holding onto this moment
                'Cause it made me fall for you
                Made me fall for you
                Take me back to the window, take me back to the door
                You'll be right where I left you sittin' on the floor
                Now I'm never gonna be alone, mm, mm
                Take me back to the window, take me back to the door
                You'll be right where I left you sittin' on the floor
                Now I'm never gonna be alone
                And I know, I know
                There's so much I want to say to you
                Even though I know
                Nothing's gonna change
                But I'll always find my way back here to you
                Take me back to the window, take me back to the door
                You'll be right where I left you sittin' on the floor
                Now I'm never gonna be alone
                (Never gonna be alone, never gonna be alone, be alone, be alone)
                Take me back to the window, take me back to the door
                You'll be right where I left you sittin' on the floor

                Plot it out in black and white
                Well, I never lived the dream of the prom kings

                Just a lie you've got to rise above

                Take the so called right track
                Faded white hats
                Grabbing credits and maybe transfers
                They read all the books but they can't find the answers
                And all of our parents, they're getting older
                I wonder if they've wished for anything better
                While in their memories tiny tragedies
                They love to tell you
                Stay inside the lines

                You will hate that I never gave more to you
                Than half of my heart
                But I can't stop loving you
                I can't stop loving you
                I can't stop loving you
                With half of my
                Half of my heart
                Half of my heart
                Half of my heart's got a real good imagination
                Half of my heart's got you
                Half of my heart's got a right mind to tell you
                That half of my heart won't do
                Half of my heart is a shotgun wedding
                To a bride with a paper ring
                And half of my heart is the part of a man
                Who's never truly loved anything
                Half of my heart

                When I was six years old, I broke my leg
                When I was running from my brother and his friends
                And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down
                Well, I was younger then, take me back to when
                I found my heart and broke it here
                Made friends and lost them through the years
                And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know I've grown
                But I can't wait to go home
                I'm on my way
                Driving at 90 down those country lanes
                Singing to "Tiny Dancer"
                And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
                And we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
                15 years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes
                Running from the law through the backfields
                And getting drunk with my friends
                Had my first kiss on a Friday night
                I don't reckon that I did it right
                But I was younger then, take me back to when
                We found weekend jobs, when we got paid
                We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
                Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh, how we've grown
                But I can't wait to go home
                I'm on my way (hoo-hoo)
                Driving at 90 down those country lanes (hoo-hoo)
                Singing to "Tiny Dancer"
                And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
                And we watched the sunset (hoo-hoo), over the castle on the hill
                Hoo-hoo, over the castle on the hill
                Hoo-hoo, over the castle on the hill
                One friend left to sell clothes, one works down by the coast
                One had two kids but lives alone, one's brother overdosed
                One's already on his second wife, one's just barely getting by
                But these people raised me and I can't wait to go home
                And I'm on my way
                I still remember these old country lanes
                When we did not know the answers
                And I miss the way (hoo-hoo) you make me feel, it's real
                When we watched the sunset (hoo-hoo) over the castle on the hill

                Sing!
                Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
                This love is ablaze
                I saw flames from the side of the stage
                And the fire brigade comes in a couple of days
                Until then, we got nothing to say
                And nothing to know
                But something to drink and maybe something to smoke
                Let it go until our roads are changed
                Singing "we found love in a local rave", no
                I don't really know what I'm supposed to say
                But I can just figure it out, and then hope and pray
                I told her my name and said, "It's nice to meet ya"
                Then she handed me a bottle of water filled with tequila
                I already know she's a keeper
                Just from this one small act of kindness
                I'm in deep if anybody finds out
                I'm meant to drive home, but I've drunk all of it now
                Not sobering up we just sit on the couch
                One thing led to another
                Now she's kissing my mouth
                I need you, darling
                Come on, set the tone
                If you feel you're falling
                Won't you let me know?
                Oh-oh, ooh-ooh

                Can you feel it?
                All the guys in here don't even wanna dance
                Can you feel it?
                All that I can hear is music from the back
                Can you feel it?
                I found you hiding here, so won't you take my hand, darling?
                Before the beat kicks in again
                Can you feel it?
                Can you feel it?
                Sing!

                And it's dark in a cold December
                But I've got ya to keep me warm
                And if you're broken I'll mend ya
                And I keep you sheltered from the storm
                That's raging on now
                I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
                I'll pick you up when you're getting down
                And out of all these things I've done
                I think I love you better now
                I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind
                I'll do it all for you in time
                And out of all these things I've done
                I think I love you better now, now
                I'm gonna paint you by numbers and color you in
                If things go right we can frame it
                And put you on a wall
                And it's so hard to say it but I've been here before
                Now I'll surrender up my heart and swap it for yours
                I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
                I'll pick you up when you're getting down
                And out of all these things I've done
                I think I love you better now
                I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind
                I'll do it all for you in time
                And out of all these things I've done
                I think I love you better now
                Don't hold me down
                I think my braces are breaking
                And it's more than I can take
                And it's dark in a cold December
                But I've got ya to keep me warm
                If you're broken I will mend ya
                And I keep you sheltered from the storm
                That's raging on now
                I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
                I'll pick you up when you're getting down
                And out of all these things I've done
                I think I love you better now
                I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind
                I'll do it all for you in time
                And out of all these things I've done

# sqlite3 in development you need to instead use DELETE to remove all data and
# it will reset the primary keys for you as well.
